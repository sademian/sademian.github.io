        <h1>Week 9 - More Roof Generation</h1>
        <p>This week I worked on improving the roof and adding trims and corner meshes</p>

        <h2>Roof Generation: More Methods</h2>
        <p>I spent a lot of hours this week improving the roof. I tried two different ways of breaking up the roof into multiple sections, however both were not very successful.</p>
        <p>The video below is of one of the methods were I tried to break the roof into sections and decide the roof shape based on the number of vertices on the outside, however I could not connect the sections nicely.</p>

        <p>The second attempt was to break the roof into smaller squares but that did not look right and was failing in some cases.</p>

        <h2>Roof Generation: Method 1 Improved</h2>
          <p>I finally decided to go back to the original roof generation I had and just fix the UV and add trims to hide the connections. Although this roof is not very accurate, I'm happy with how it looks and I needed to move on to other work.</p>
          <p>The left picture is before the improvements and the right one is after</p>

        <h2>Next Week</h2>
        <p>Next week, I will be working on adding a trim under the roof, polishing, and preparing for the final presentation.</a></p>
