        <h1>Week 6 - Generating Windows and Doors</h1>
        <p>This week I worked on adding windows and doors.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sec">
        <h2>Adding Window and Door Mesh classes</h2>
        <p>I derived two classes from my Modular Piece class for the doors and winows. The reason I decided to derive classes instead of making a type enum is because I wanted to use unreal's class parameter filtering</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sec">
        <h2>Procedural Windows/Door Generation</h2>
        <p>Next, I worked on generating the windows and doors layout. Currently, the algorithm I wrote attempts to place a window at a 1/3 chance most of the time. If two windows are placed next to each other then a door is chosen next to make sure there are no possibility of generating 3 windows next to each other, on the other hand if we have two consecutive walls then the chance of having a window next increases to 1/2.</p>

        <h2>Next Week</h2>
        <p>Next week, I will be working on adjusting the windows/doors placements and adding simple flat roof.</a></p>
