        <h1>Week 3 - Floorplan Manipulation</h1>
        <p>This week I have been focused on the floorplan manipulation and cleaning up the code to start generating the floorplans, I wanted to have the floorplan generation done this week but the tasks that needed to be done first ended up taking the entire time.</p>

        <h2>Code Refactoring</h2>
        
        <p>Before this week I had been storing just a single spline and a couple of variables because there were some questions still being answered. In order to move forward I had to spend a couple of hours refactoring the code so I can store the data in a better way and adjust the methods to work for any level spline. I added a levelData struct to store the variables that would be different for every level and stored a levels array in the building class. I also moved the code in the construction method into smaller methods.</p>

      <div class="sec">

        <h2>Dynamic Corners</h2>
        
        <p>I added room for a corner mesh since wall segments are usually modeled with corner meshes to close wall gap. Also added some math to adjust the floorplan when the corner length changed.</p>

        <h2>Segment Size Snapping</h2>
        
        <p>I added snapping for manipulating the spline points based on the current segment length.</p>

      <div class="sec">

        <h2>Dynamic Segment Length</h2>
        
        <p>I added floorplan adjustments for when the segment length changes, I used scaling with some additional math to keep the corner length unchanged.</a></p>

        <h2>Next Week</h2>
        
        <p>I will work on generating footprints using subtractive shape generation and adding multiple floors.</a></p>
