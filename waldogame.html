        <h2>Premise: </h2>
        <p>You're trying to collect the hidden Waldo game pieces and make your way to the exit. The only issue is you're in an area full of Waldo look-alikes and the real Waldo is trying to kill you. Close encounters with Waldo require you to Sprint and hide in the environment to have Waldo lose your trail and get another opportunity to seek out the hidden game pieces. You can only make your way to the exit once you've collected all the Waldo game pieces.<br/></p>

        <p><br/>- We have completed development of the win state. As demonstrated in the video above the player is only able to pass through the gate if all 5 items are collected. Otherwise, an audio clip will be played to signify that the player has not yet collected all the items<br/></p>

        <img src="waldo/bp6.png" style="height: 350px;"/>
        <p><br/>- Only the player would have the ability to collect and keep track of how many items are within the event inventory<br/></p>
        <img src="waldo/bp7.png" style="height: 350px;"/>
        <p><br/>- Each individual items will call on its event manager and check if the item has been collected or not if it has not been collected a "rejection" audio sound will play to signify to the player that they have not yet collected all the items. If they do have all the items then the door animation will play and the win state will display<br/></p>

        <h2>Week of November 26, 2018<br/></h2>
        <p>- In the following item spawning BP the "Volume" would refer to the area that is designated to spawn items. It will take a random X and Y and place the items at that desired location. This action will be designated on "SpawnNewItem" Event. This event will check that the X and Y coordinate do not hide inside assets in the environment. Each asset has a "NoSpawnItem" Box which sets the boundaries of each individual asset. If the X and Y coordinate match with the any point within the "NOSpawnBox" it will run the "SpawnNewItem" event again till it finds a location in the playing field.<br/></p>

        <p><br/>- Items hiding with in objects resolution: In the following BP the a call on all five item event are done within 0.2 seconds.<br/></p>
        <img src="waldo/bp3.png" style="height: 300px;"/>
        <p><br/>- as previously the boundaries of the spawning box are picked at random X and Y coordinates and put into a vector.<br/></p>
        <img src="waldo/bp4.png" style="height: 300px;"/>
        <p><br/>- This vector will then be send to each individual items event handler which will then look if the coordinates that were produced are equal to any coordinates within the "NoSpawnBox" (Which are set on each of the assets within the game). If the coordinates match to any coordinate within the "NoSpawnBox" it will call on the event handler again to ask for another coordinate. if the coordinate does not match then the item will be placed in given location that was produced. This procedure is done throughout all 5 items.<br/></p>

        <h2>Week of November 12, 2018<br/></h2>
        <p>- We improved the crowd wandering AI. Before, the characters would pick a random location within a certain radius; their behavior felt unrealistic because sometimes they would make sharp turns. Now, the characters choose a random point on the radius of a circle in front of them; this limits the angle change. When the character is in a location where they can't move forward because they are blocked by an object or person, they then choose a random point on a circle behind them instead.<br/></p>

        <h2>Week of November 5, 2018<br/></h2>
        <p>- Fixed the problems in Waldo's animation<br/>- Added music to the main menu<br/>- Incorporated a block boundary to maintain the player within the environment of the game<br/>- Added a slight fog and inputted the Exit sign to the game. Once the player collects all 5 items they will be able to leave the circus<br/></p>

        <p><br/>- The following Door_BP goes over the interaction between the player and the door. The Door will cast to the third player and check if the slot items have reached the 5 total items for collection. Once this is done it will set the slot number to 5 which will then go into the time line. in the time line there is clean parabola that will perform movement of the door in a smooth transition in a period of 1 second<br/></p>

        <h2>Week of October 29, 2018<br/></h2>
        <p>- We rigged and animated the Waldo model but are having some issues with Waldo's animation<br/>- We have constructed a blueprint for the Waldo AI that will chase down the player once it falls in its line of vision. At the moment the line of vision is set to 45degrees, which is very close to realistic vision of scope. It still requires some tweaking. You can see the problems with the animation and AI in the video below<br/></p>

        <h2>Week of October 22, 2018<br/></h2>
        <p>- We started working on the crowd roaming AI, we have a basic version that still needs improving. In the video below, you can see the current roaming AI. When a character collides with an object or another character, he stops and chooses a new destination instead of navigating around it<br/></p>
        <iframe width="455" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xG86hgEOCPE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p><br/>- We added a couple of characters to the world. This process has been challenging for more than one reason. It's hard to find enough characters that fit the theme, and sometimes I find a 3D mesh without the textures and it would take to long to make it ourselves. It also takes some time to get the characters rigged on Mixamo (and sometimes it doesn't work), pick different walking and ideling animations that look good, download them and upload them to unreal, and then create an animation blueprint. We are also still experimenting with changing textures on characters to make them look different. We just found out about Photoshop Fuse, currently free, which can be used to easily customize 3D characters so we'll experiment with it.<br/></p>

        <h2>Week of October 15, 2018<br/></h2>
        <p>- We had our first playable presentation this week<br/>- Most of the UI is complete<br/>- We have been learning how to mamanipulate textures for the people to create a diverse crowd using limited 3D characters, for example the second character below was created by changing the skin material and if we have different animations for the characters (different walk style, idle styles ...) we can have a better crowd<br/></p>

        <h2>Week of October 8, 2018<br/></h2>
        <p>- We are working on our powerpoint for the first-playable presentation<br/>- We modified the game to be a True First Person Point of view<br/>- We started working on the HUD<br/>- Gave player ability to sprint away from danger by holding down the Left_Shift key.  The following blueprint illustrates the Sprint action being called on once user presses the shift key. When pressed Player will accelerates a max speed of 1600 when released it will go back down to a more normal walk of 800. This will be will be helpful in running away from Waldo<br/></p>
        <img src="waldo/code0.png" style="height: 300px;" />
        <p><br/>- Updated HUD to display objects as they are collected. Set all the Items with a particular variable number under one particular slot. once player goes over an item the number will push to the slot the ID number of the item overwritten anything that might of been there before. Blueprint illustrates the set up of ID numbers per item. As seen if the slot varible is >= 0 it will override and "set" a int value (ex set slot1item = 3). Furthermore, creating the HUD widget interaction once player collects item is stored in the "ThirdPersonCharacter". By using the int variable "Slot1Item"in a "switch on variable" call we are able to change the opacity of each individual item widget once there ID number is collected from the ThirdPersonCharacter.<br/></p>

        <img src="waldo/code2.png" style="height: 370px;" />
        <p><br/>- Item Randomization: We were able to finally compile a working random assortment of the items through the environment. In the following blueprint you can see There is a "volume" object which represents a box to create the range of the environment in which random spawning may occur. We take the x and y variable of the "volume" component to make sure it is placed some where near the ground and set the z variable at default 0. Once a random x and y have been selected they are made into a vector which is given out to the spawning items individual at the beginning of the game.<br/></p>
