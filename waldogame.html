        <h2>Premise: </h2>
        <p>You're trying to collect the hidden Waldo game pieces and make your way to the exit. The only issue is you're in an area full of Waldo look-alikes and the real Waldo is trying to kill you. Close encounters with Waldo require you to Sprint and hide in the environment to have Waldo lose your trail and get another opportunity to seek out the hidden game pieces. You can only make your way to the exit once you've collected all the Waldo game pieces.<br/></p>
