        <p>Hello and welcome to my space! My name is Sandy Demian and I'm a software engineer at Electronic Arts (EA) who is passionate about combining creativity and programming. I have always enjoyed creative hobbies like crafts, interior design, cake decorating, and playing The Sims for hours! I was introduced to programming my first semester in college and fell in love with it. Problem solving, breaking down tasks, and system design pushed my creativity further and was very satisfying. <br><br> I graduated with my Bachelor's in computer science in 2018 and felt like I wanted to get into a more creative field, so I decided to get my Master's in game programming at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy, also known as FIEA. At FIEA, I got to grow by making games with artists, producers, and programmers. I enjoyed learning game programming best practices, building a small game engine, working on a slightly larger capstone game,<a href="Projects/Izcalli.html"> Izcalli of the Wind</a>, and improving my C++ while being guided by professors who came from the industry. You can see some of my programming projects <a href="projects.html"> here.</a><br><br>My undergraduate programming foundation and the skills I gained at FIEA helped prepare me for an internship at Epic Games. My time on Fortnite’s UI team taught me a lot about collaboration and working on a large team of producers, artists, and engineers. My internship at Epic also helped get me familiar with navigating a large codebase. After my internship I found a spot on an innovative team at EA where I worked on a project to extend the replay capabilities of the Frostbite Engine. On this project, I got to work with the engine team and game teams and played a major role in moving the project from a prototype to a final product.</p>
