        <p>Hello and welcome to my space! My name is Sandy Demian and I'm a software engineer who is passionate about combining creativity and programming.
        I have always enjoyed creative hobbies like crafts, interior design, cake decorating, and playing The Sims for hours! I was introduced to programming my first semester in college and fell in love with it. Problem solving, breaking down tasks, and system design pushed my creativity further and was very satisfying. <br><br> I graduated with my Bachelor's in computer science in 2018 and felt like I wanted to get into a more creative field, so I decided to get my Master's in game programming at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy, also known as FIEA. At FIEA, I got to grow by making games with artists, producers, and programmers. I enjoyed learning game programming best practices, building a small game engine, working on a slightly larger capstone game,<a href="Projects/Izcalli.html"> Izcalli of the Wind</a>, and improving my C++ while being guided by professors who came from the industry. You can see some of my programming projects <a href="projects.html"> here.</a><br><br>My undergrad programming foundation and the skills I gained at FIEA helped me in getting an internship at Epic Games with Fortnite's UI team. Working on a huge game has some challenges but it is also very rewarding to see my work extend and improve Fortnite. As an engineer on Fortnite I also got experience working on very large data driven systems and getting experience in areas I was not too familiar with like multiple clients and server. It has also been interesting working with a huge team of producers, artists, and engineers and learning how we can all play a part in improving our game.</p>
        <!--<p>I'm currently studying game programming at Florida Interactive Enertainment Academy. I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a bachelor's in Computer Science in 2018.
        <br><br>I'm seeking an internship in the entertainment field for Fall 2020 where I can combine my programming skills and artistic interests. My resume can be found <a href="resume.html">here;</a> additional programming projects can be found <a href="projects.html">here.</a>
        <br><br>When I am not programming or playing Sims, you might find me painting, drawing, bullet journaling, or building minature houses; I have some of my artwork <a href="artwork.html">here.</a> I also love going to theme parks, ice skating, watching movies, or just relaxing outside when the weather is nice.</p>-->
