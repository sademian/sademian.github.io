            <p>Hello and welcome to my space! My name is Sandy Demian and I'm a software engineer at Electronic Arts (EA) who is passionate about combining creativity and programming. I have always enjoyed creative hobbies like crafts, interior design, and cake decorating! I was introduced to programming my first semester in college and fell in love with it. Problem solving, breaking down tasks, and system design pushed my creativity further and was very satisfying.</p>
            <p><br>I graduated with my Bachelor's in computer science in 2018 and wanted to go into game development so I decided to get my Master's in game programming at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy, also known as FIEA. At FIEA, I got to grow by making games with artists, producers, and programmers. I enjoyed learning game programming best practices, building a small game engine, working on a slightly larger capstone game, <a href="Projects/Izcalli.html">Izcalli of the Wind</a>, and improving my C++ while being guided by professors who came from the industry. You can see some of my programming projects <a href="projects.html"> here.</a><br></p>
            <p><br>During grad school I interned at Epic Games. My time on Fortnite’s UI team taught me a lot about collaboration, working on a large interdisciplinary team, and navigating a large codebase. After graduation, I found a spot on an innovative team at EA where I worked on a project to extend the replay capabilities of the Frostbite Engine. On this project, I got to work with the engine team and a game team and played a major role in moving the project from a prototype to a final product. After that team was cut due to budget cuts I joined Maxis to work on the next gen Sims game.<br></p>
