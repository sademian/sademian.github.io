            <h3>Gameplay Programmer</h3>
            <p>A VR game prototype using the Oculus Quest to teach medical staff how to use the DaVinci Surgical machine to prepare for surgery. This was a group project for a class in partnership with Advent Health. I was the only programmer in a multidisciplinary team of 8. This game was very interesting and challenging since it was my first VR game and recreating the DaVini's movement was very important; therefore making sure the VR interactions with the machine worked well took most of the game's production time. The machine's movements were generated based on the player's hand movement near the buttons and the parts of the machine that can be moved.</p><br>

            <h3>Gameplay Programmer</h3>
            <p>Recreated level 1 of Super Mario Bros in C++ with another programmer for an assignment. I worked on the general game flow, menus, sprites and animations, and creating a text representation of the level so the collision boxes and the enemys are in the corect positions in the level. I also worked on the camera system to move in the level similar to the original game. We were not able to add all the details like the audio and the fire projectiles (for Fire Mario) since we had less than 3 weeks to complete this.</p><br>

The project is sponsored by professors Ryan Byussens and Matt Dombrowski. We used the Emotiv Epoc+ headset to obtain the EEG brain scans.</p><br>
